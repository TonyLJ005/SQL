#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--1 How many orders were placed in January? 9681
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 379 iPhones
SELECT COUNT(orderID), Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone' 
AND orderid <> 'orderID'
AND length(orderID) = 6
;

--3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct(acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_ID = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'orderID'
;

--4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct(Product), price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)
;

--OR
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1
;

--OR
SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1
;

--5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as Revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product
;

--6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity), Product, SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
Group BY product
;

--7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT SUM(quantity), product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
Group BY Product
;

--9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(quantity) >= 3
; 

--10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT sum(Quantity) as quantity, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE '%Headphones%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY Product
;

--11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
--Could also use "SELECT avg(quantity*price)"
SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderID=cust.order_ID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
JOIN customers cust
ON FEB.orderID = cust.order_id
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*Price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY sum(quantity*price) desc 
LIMIT 1
;
